# Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository will contain some GAN applications.

## Project structure
- üìÅ `Datasets` at root will contain all the datasets used for every model (not saved on git)
- üìÅ `tensorboard` at any depth will data for **Tensorboard** (not saved on git)
- üìÅ `models state_dict` dir will contain the models state_dict as well as a json file detailing training, model
architecture, hyperparameters and some results (loss, accuracy, etc.)
- `helpers.py` will contain reusable functions for the scripts (they all come with documentation, read and use them as needed)
- `playground.py` a place where you can test Pytorch layers usage, anything really
- üìÅ `Prototypes` will contain prototypes used for testing and tunning the models before releasing the final version

## Datasets that need to be downloaded manually
- Cats & Dogs

# Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository will contain some GAN applications.

## Project structure
- üìÅ `Datasets` at root will contain all the datasets used for every model (not saved on git)
- üìÅ `tensorboard` at any depth will contain data for **Tensorboard** (not saved on git)
- üìÅ `models state_dict` dir will contain the models state_dict as well as a json file detailing training, model
- üìÅ `Prototypes` will contain prototypes used for testing and tunning the models before releasing the final version
architecture, hyperparameters and some results (loss, accuracy, etc.)
- `env.py` contains state used across the project, currently stores the names for directories (Datasets, tensorboard, ...) which you can change
the name of here if you want
- `helpers.py` will contain reusable functions for the scripts (they all come with documentation, read and use them as needed)
- `playground.py` a place where you can test Pytorch layers usage, anything really


## Datasets that need to be downloaded manually
- [Cats & Dogs](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tongpython/cat-and-dog)
- [food-101](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/dansbecker/food-101)
- [Animal faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/andrewmvd/animal-faces)
- [Human faces 2 genders](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ashwingupta3012/male-and-female-faces-dataset)
- [Human faces emotions](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/ananthu017/emotion-detection-fer)
- [Manga faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/davidgamalielarcos/manga-faces-dataset)
- [Simpsons faces](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/kostastokis/simpsons-faces)

See `helpers.py` - `load_custom_img_dataset` on how to load these datasets in PyTorch.

I haven't used every dataset from this list, but if you want to add more, make sure to add the name of the dir in `load_custom_img_dataset`. It's not required but it's nice to have intellisense. Also keep in mind to respect the folder structure, which you can view in the docstring of the function.

```python
def load_custom_img_dataset(dataset: Literal["Name of dataset dir"], ...)
```

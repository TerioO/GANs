# Generative Adversarial Networks

This repository will contain some GAN applications.

## Project structure
- `Datasets` folder at root will contain all the datasets used for every model.
- `logs` folder at any depth will contain all training results for the models (files used by
tensorboard, images, text files, etc.).
- `models state_dict` will contain the models state_dict as well as a json file with some training data
  (epochs trained, results per epoch, etc.)
